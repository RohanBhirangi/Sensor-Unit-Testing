# Sensor-Unit-Testing

The task involves accomplishing 4 main tasks.
Task 1: Write a sample repy script which serves as a Unit Test. This can be directly uploaded to the smartphone and can test sensor calls.

Task 2: Come up with a Python script that starts the turn table and arbitrarily controls its motion. If possible, the same script should also upload the Arduino ino code to the Arduino board.

Task 3: Develop a python program which performs all the Seash functions (loadkeys, browse, upload, execute). This is basically used to conduct the tests from a single program instead of having to perform all the tasks manually.

Task 4: Integrate all of the above into a single Unit testing framework for Sensibility Testbed.
